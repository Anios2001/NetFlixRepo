# NetFlixRepo
NetFlix Project with Nullclass
## Problem Statement 
The problem was of circular Subscription and Account Management employed by Netflix.
One of friends used to buy a subscription with the community money we gathered and then we used to use the account on rolling basis. The concurrent connections were 10 and we were a group of 20 people wanting to watch 20 different movies in the same 3 hour off time we got from our studies. 
### The following plausible solutions were not optimal 
1. Just change the time.  We had limited time of our studies.
2. Watch some movies together. Not Possible we had a Tech Marvel Fan to a Magic Harry Potter to dashing DC Fan.
3. Do something else, really we are problem solvers we do everything with code.
So, me and my 5 nerd friends decided we want our own service hosted on using combined hosting capacity of our mobile phones to do that. We got to the drwaing board and came up with a distributed CDN for mobiles with minimal throughput loss and whose capacity to manage the throughput increased with addition of new users.
"Design a system capable of streaming HD Quality content from a central server using the hosting capability of the connected nodes."
